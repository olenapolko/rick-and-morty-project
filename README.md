# Description

This is a small React-based app that utilizes the Rick&Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com) to provide users with information about characters from the show. The app allows users to search for specific characters and filter the results, with a responsive design that does not rely on UI libraries. Characters are displayed in alphabetical order. Navigation between pages is handled through React Router DOM, and Google authentication and login are supported. Additional components include a spinner and error messages, and pagination is implemented using ReactPaginate. Error boundaries are also employed for improved error handling.ðŸ™‚
